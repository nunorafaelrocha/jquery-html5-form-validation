# JQuery Html5 form validation

This project is **deprecated**, and I recommend you to use an aternative such as [Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/). 

### Deprecated
Perform html5 validation on a certain group of elements using javascript. 
With this you can also perform html5 validation on browsers wich don't support it natively.
